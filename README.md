# favplaces-app

This react-native app allows you to keep a record of your favorite places. It's like a diary where you can store locally in the device (in a SQLite database),
information about your favorite places. In this app I used the following:

*React-native with Expo

*Google maps static API

*Google geocoding API

*SQLite (for the database)

*Javascript (React)

*Native features of a smartphone like the camera and the location service (gps)

Here is a demo of the app:
